# piscine42
My experience in the 42SP's Piscine Feb-Mar 2023.
In this repository, you will find all the lists of exercises I've made during the Piscine so far.

### About the experience
I won't have enough words to express what is to be in the Piscine, but I have a word for it: Opportunity.
École 42 gave me the opportunity to change my status quo. I had once again the courage to try again something very challenging, but in a safe space built in the community of 42.

Worth every minute there~

### My achievements
I've made until the C05 list of exercises (skipped the Shel01 list).

My last exam's score was 72/100. It was my best grade of all exams!
And finished the Piscine with level 06.

I could interact with sooo many different people... i would never imagine talking with them in normal circumstances!
It was refreshing!
